# UniSprouts
This is Family Tree of Unisprouts

Reading in data from a 2d Array Matrix, the program counstructs a "Family Tree" LinkedList with keeping generations intact. The user can then get a list of any persons relatives.

This project uses doubly-linked lists and recursion. While a Binary/RB tree seems more intuitive, the program required two seperate pointers and didn't need to be sorted. 

The average time complexity is O(N)

The main file is "FamilyTreeOfUniSprouts_CLIENT_SHELL.java", and the Linked List Nodes are object of "FamilyTreeOfUniSprouts_Node.java"
